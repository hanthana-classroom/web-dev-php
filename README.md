1. __Preparing the development environment.__

  In this session we will focus on getting all the participants to have a
  working LAMP stack under default configuration.

2. __Creating configuring the project.__

  We will create directories to keep our source and configuration files, and
  also create the database and user specific to our project.

  Then we write a simple script to make sure everything works, and commit
  everything to a local git repository.

3. __Developing the project (a Link sharing application)__

  Our end product will be a service where users can submit links to interesting
  resources, and other user can vote up/down them.

  3.1. Create data model

  3.2. Unit testing with [PHPUnit] [phpunit_homepage]

    * Using [Composer] [composer_homepage] to manage dependencies.

  3.3. Create basic CRUD for the modal

    * Validating user input using [jQuery] [jquery_homepage]

  3.4. User authentication using OpenID ([LightOpenID] [lightopenid_repo])

  3.5. Make things look nice with [Bootstrap] [bootstrap_homepage]

  3.6. Create voting system with AJAX

4. __Deploying the application__

  When we have a application that is ready for the world to see (a minimum
  viable product), we will publish the web site on to the hosting platform
  [Heroku] [heroku_homepage].

5. __Releasing the project as a Free/Libre Open Source Software application__

  We walk-through the changes and additions that we have to make to our project
  in order to release as a free software project under GNU Affero GPL license.
